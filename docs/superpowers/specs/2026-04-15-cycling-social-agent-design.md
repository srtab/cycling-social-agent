# Cycling Social Agent — Design Spec

- **Date:** 2026-04-15
- **Status:** Approved (brainstorming)
- **Owner:** Sandro Rodrigues
- **Repo:** `~/work/personal/cycling-social-agent/` (standalone)

## 1. Summary

A personal automation agent that watches a pro cyclist's Strava account for race activities and produces approval-gated social media posts on Facebook and Instagram. Posts mix technical race data with the rider's first-person voice, always credit sponsors, are reviewed via a Telegram bot or a local web UI, and are published at a configurable time of day for engagement.

The agent is implemented as a **DeepAgents** orchestrator (LangChain ecosystem) running locally on the rider's laptop. State is persisted in SQLite so that sleep/wake cycles and multi-hour approval delays do not lose work. A small FastAPI + TailwindCSS web UI runs in the same process for management, history browsing, and an alternative approval surface.

## 2. Goals

- Detect new race activities on Strava automatically (no manual trigger).
- Generate platform-tailored draft posts in Portuguese and English for Facebook Page and Instagram Business.
- Always include the configured sponsors in every post.
- Capture the rider's voice via few-shot examples plus a per-race "feeling" note pulled from the Strava activity's private description.
- Require explicit human approval (with edit / regenerate / reject options) before any post is published.
- Publish approved posts at a configurable time of day, with an "approve & post now" override.
- Provide a local web UI (TailwindCSS) for managing sponsors, style examples, and browsing post history — with the Telegram bot remaining the primary on-the-go approval channel.
- Support an opt-in `reflect` workflow that mines approval feedback (edits, regenerate hints, rejects) and proposes style-guide updates for the rider to apply.
- Be robust to laptop sleep, intermittent connectivity, and approvals that take hours.

## 3. Non-goals (v1)

- Auto-publishing without human approval.
- Stories, Reels, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Threads, Bluesky.
- Sponsor tiers, rotation, or contractual logic — flat sponsor list, all mentioned every time.
- Retroactive posts for races prior to install date.
- Multi-rider / team support.
- Authentication / multi-user access for the web UI — bound to `127.0.0.1` only.
- Autonomous self-modification of the style guide — `reflect` proposes diffs, the rider applies them.
- Hosted deployment (VPS, cloud). Laptop-only for v1, with a Raspberry Pi migration path noted in §15.

## 4. Architectural decisions

### 4.1 Top-level orchestration: DeepAgents (not a fixed LangGraph workflow)

The orchestrator is a single deep agent invoked once per scheduler tick. It uses a planning tool, a set of tools, and one type of sub-agent. It decides each cycle which races to process and in what order, bounded by tool-enforced invariants and a per-cycle scope cap.

**Rationale:** the workflow has a creative core (drafting) and a small but real amount of state-dependent reasoning (which drafts still need work, how to handle a rejection, when to give up and alert). A deep-agent loop expresses this naturally with less glue code than a state graph, while sub-agents give clean isolated contexts for each draft.

**Trade-off accepted:** higher LLM cost than a deterministic workflow, mitigated by a cheap model for orchestration, a per-cycle scope cap, and a smart-but-bounded model for drafting.

### 4.2 Approval as DB state machine, not blocking await

`send_for_approval` does not await the user. It posts to Telegram and writes the draft as `awaiting_approval` in SQLite with the Telegram message ID. The bot writes the user's response back to SQLite. Subsequent agent cycles read the state and act.

**Rationale:** the laptop will sleep. A blocking `await` across hours of sleep is fragile. A DB-mediated handoff is laptop-sleep-safe, lets multiple drafts be in flight, and keeps the bot and agent processes loosely coupled.

### 4.3 Drafting as a per-(platform, language) sub-agent

Each draft is produced by a fresh drafter sub-agent invocation with isolated context: activity summary, feeling text, sponsors, language-specific style examples, platform constraints. Returns the final caption + suggested hashtags.

**Rationale:** clean context per draft prevents cross-contamination (e.g., the FB long-form draft leaking into the IG short-form draft). Sub-agents internally do draft → self-critique → refine, which is where deep-agent shape earns its keep over a single LLM call.

### 4.4 Tools enforce invariants

Without a fixed workflow, ordering and policy are enforced by the tools themselves:

- `send_for_approval` rejects drafts missing any sponsor handle from `sponsors.yaml`.
- `publish_to_*` rejects unless the draft status in DB is `approved`.
- `mark_processed` rejects unless every (platform × language) draft for the activity is in a terminal state (`published` or `rejected`).

The agent has freedom in *what* to do but no path to violate these invariants.

## 6. Workflow

### 6.1 Per-cycle loop (every N minutes)

A scheduler in `runner.py` invokes the orchestrator agent with the standing instruction:

> Process new race activities. Plan: (1) list_new_races; (2) for each race not yet fully published, fetch context including the "feeling" from the activity's private description; (3) for each (platform × language) combination not yet drafted, render media and spawn a drafter sub-agent; (4) call send_for_approval for new drafts; (5) call check_approval_status for any pending approvals — for each that became `approved` since last cycle, schedule_publish (or publish immediately if "post now" was selected); (6) call publish_due_drafts to send any drafts whose scheduled time has arrived; (7) record state. Process at most one race per cycle. If nothing to do, exit.

The agent writes its plan as a todo list (DeepAgents planning tool), executes, exits.

### 6.2 Per-race state machine (in DB)

Activity transitions:

```
detected → drafting → awaiting_approval → processed
```

`processed` is reached only via `mark_processed`, which fires when every (platform × language) draft is in a terminal state (`published` or `rejected`). An activity can therefore end up `processed` with a mix of published and rejected drafts; per-draft outcome lives on the `drafts` table, not on the activity.

Each `(activity_id, platform, language)` draft transitions independently:

```
pending → drafted → awaiting_approval ─► approved ─► scheduled ─► published
                                     │           └─► (post-now) ─► published
                                     ├─► rejected
                                     ├─► editing → awaiting_approval
                                     └─► regenerating → drafted
```

`scheduled` carries a `scheduled_for` timestamp set by `schedule_publish` based on `PUBLISH_TIME_LOCAL` and `PUBLISH_TIMEZONE` (see §13). When the rider taps **Approve & post now** in Telegram or the web UI, the state machine skips `scheduled` and goes straight to `published` on the next cycle. An activity is `processed` only when every draft is in a terminal state (`published` or `rejected`).

### 6.3 Approval UX (Telegram + web UI)

The Telegram bot is the primary on-the-go surface; the web UI is an alternative that exposes the same actions. Both write to the same `drafts` rows, so a draft approved on one surface is reflected on the other on next refresh.

For each draft the Telegram bot sends a message containing:

- Rendered media (route map composite + stats card; optional rider photo if attached later)
- Draft caption + hashtags
- Inline buttons: ✅ Approve (queued) | ⚡ Approve & post now | ✏️ Edit | 🔄 Regenerate | ❌ Reject

Flows:

- **Approve (queued):** bot writes `approved` to DB. Next agent cycle calls `schedule_publish`, which sets `scheduled_for` to the next occurrence of `PUBLISH_TIME_LOCAL`. Draft moves to `scheduled`. Bot sends a confirmation message with the scheduled time.
- **Approve & post now:** bot writes `approved` with `post_now=true`. Next cycle publishes immediately, skipping `scheduled`.
- **Edit:** bot prompts for replacement caption; rider replies; bot re-renders preview; rider can approve or edit again.
- **Regenerate:** bot prompts for an optional hint (e.g., "more grateful, less hype"). Hint is logged to `approval_events` and passed to the drafter sub-agent on retry.
- **Reject:** bot writes `rejected` to DB. No publish.
- **Photo attach:** before approval, rider can reply with one or more photos. Bot stores them and they replace the auto-generated stats card image (or augment it; rider chooses via a follow-up button).

The web UI offers the same five actions on each draft card via HTMX-driven inline controls, plus the ability to edit the `scheduled_for` timestamp on a draft already in `scheduled` state.

### 6.4 Reflect (opt-in feedback mining)

`uv run cycling-agent reflect` (or a button in the web UI's settings page) spawns the **reflector sub-agent** with read-only access to `approval_events` and the current style example files. The reflector returns a markdown diff suggesting:

- New style examples to add (drawn from edits the rider made to drafts)
- Existing examples to retire (drawn from regenerate hints that contradict them)
- Style-guide refinements (drawn from recurring rejection or edit patterns)

The diff is written to `data/reflect-proposals/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. The rider reviews and applies manually — the agent never modifies the style files autonomously.

## 7. Data model (SQLite via SQLAlchemy)

| Table | Key fields |
|---|---|
| `activities` | `id` (Strava activity id), `started_at`, `name`, `workout_type`, `feeling_text`, `status`, `created_at`, `processed_at` |
| `drafts` | `id`, `activity_id`, `platform` (`facebook`/`instagram`), `language` (`pt`/`en`), `caption`, `hashtags`, `media_paths`, `status`, `telegram_message_id`, `feedback_hint`, `regenerate_count`, `scheduled_for` (nullable timestamp), `post_now` (bool, default false), `approval_source` (`telegram`/`web`/null), `created_at`, `updated_at` |
| `posts` | `id`, `draft_id`, `platform`, `external_post_id`, `published_at` |
| `sponsors` | `id`, `name`, `handle_facebook`, `handle_instagram`, `hashtag` (loaded from `sponsors.yaml` on startup) |
| `style_examples` | `id`, `language`, `text`, `enabled` (loaded from markdown files on startup) |
| `agent_runs` | `id`, `started_at`, `finished_at`, `tool_call_count`, `cost_estimate_usd`, `outcome`, `error_text` |
| `approval_events` | `id`, `draft_id`, `event` (`approved`/`edited`/`regenerated`/`rejected`/`photo_added`), `payload`, `at` |

`approval_events` gives an audit trail and is the data source for tuning the style guide and few-shot examples over time.

## 8. External integrations

### 8.1 Strava

- **Auth:** OAuth2 with refresh token; first-run CLI flow to obtain tokens.
- **Polling:** `GET /athlete/activities` every N minutes (default 10). Filter for `type in (Ride, Run)` and `workout_type` matching race codes (Ride: `11`, Run: `1`).
- **Detail fetch:** for each candidate, `GET /activities/{id}` to read `description` (the "feeling"), `map.summary_polyline`, splits, segments, and stream stats.
- **Rate budget:** Strava API allows 100 req / 15 min and 1000 / day. At 10-min poll interval that's 144 list calls/day plus ~5–10 detail calls per race. Comfortable margin.

### 8.2 Meta (Facebook + Instagram)

- **Auth:** long-lived Page Access Token for the Facebook Page; Instagram Business account linked to the Page.
- **App permissions required:** `pages_manage_posts`, `pages_read_engagement`, `instagram_basic`, `instagram_content_publish`. App review may be needed depending on Meta policy at implementation time.
- **Facebook publishing:** `POST /{page-id}/photos` (single image) or `/feed` (text + media). Local file upload supported.
- **Instagram publishing:** two-step. (1) Create media container with `POST /{ig-user-id}/media` — requires `image_url` for image media. (2) Publish container with `POST /{ig-user-id}/media_publish`.
- **The IG `image_url` constraint:** Instagram cannot accept a local file directly. Three options for the laptop-only deployment:
  - **Option A:** Use Facebook's `/photos` upload (which does accept local files) to upload the image to a private FB album, then use the resulting CDN URL as `image_url` for the IG container. No external infra needed. **This is the chosen approach for v1.**
  - Option B: ngrok-style tunnel from laptop. Adds a runtime dependency.
  - Option C: small object store (Cloudflare R2 free tier). Adds an external service.

### 8.3 Telegram

- **Auth:** bot token from BotFather; rider's chat ID hardcoded in config (single-user app).
- **Mode:** long-polling. No public URL needed; works behind any NAT.
- **Library:** `python-telegram-bot` v21+.

## 9. Tools (interface contracts)

All tools are async. All state-modifying tools are idempotent w.r.t. their primary key.

| Tool | Inputs | Output | Invariant enforced |
|---|---|---|---|
| `list_new_races()` | — | list of activity ids not yet in DB or in non-terminal state | — |
| `get_activity_detail(id)` | activity id | full activity dict + feeling text | — |
| `read_sponsors()` | — | list of sponsor dicts | — |
| `read_style_examples(language)` | `pt`/`en` | list of past-post strings | — |
| `render_stats_card(activity)` | activity dict | path to PNG | — |
| `render_route_map(activity)` | activity dict | path to PNG | — |
| `send_for_approval(activity_id, platform, language, caption, hashtags, media_paths)` | as named | telegram message id | rejects if any sponsor handle missing from caption |
| `check_approval_status(draft_id)` | draft id | `pending` / `approved(post_now)` / `edited(text)` / `regenerated(hint)` / `rejected` | — |
| `schedule_publish(draft_id)` | draft id | `scheduled_for` timestamp | rejects unless draft status == `approved`; computes next occurrence of `PUBLISH_TIME_LOCAL` |
| `publish_due_drafts()` | — | list of published draft ids | publishes each draft with `status=scheduled` and `scheduled_for <= now`; also publishes drafts with `status=approved` and `post_now=true` |
| `publish_to_facebook(draft_id)` | draft id | external post id | rejects unless draft status in (`scheduled` past due, `approved` with `post_now`) |
| `publish_to_instagram(draft_id)` | draft id | external post id | rejects unless draft status in (`scheduled` past due, `approved` with `post_now`) |
| `mark_processed(activity_id)` | activity id | success | rejects unless all drafts in terminal state |
| `log_feedback(draft_id, kind, payload)` | as named | success | — |

## 10. Cost model and guardrails

- **Models:** Haiku for the orchestrator (cheap planning + tool dispatch), Sonnet for the drafter sub-agent (creative work).
- **Per-cycle cap:** at most one race processed per scheduler tick. Pending races are picked up on the next tick.
- **Tool-call cap:** orchestrator capped at ~30 tool calls per cycle (DeepAgents `recursion_limit`). Hitting the cap logs a warning and sends a Telegram alert; cycle exits.
- **Idle-cycle short-circuit:** if `list_new_races` returns empty the orchestrator should exit in 1–2 LLM calls. Verified in tests.
- **Estimated cost:** sub-cent per idle cycle; ~$0.30 per race (4 drafts × drafter loop). Well below any meaningful budget for personal use.

## 10a. Web UI scope (v1)

A small server-rendered UI that runs in the same process as the agent and bot. Not a SPA. No build pipeline.

**Stack**

- FastAPI for routes and lifecycle (mounts cleanly into the same asyncio event loop as the bot and scheduler).
- Jinja2 for templates.
- TailwindCSS via CDN (`cdn.tailwindcss.com`) — keeps the project zero-config; switch to a built CSS bundle later if/when bundle size matters.
- HTMX for inline approve/edit/reject without page reloads.
- No JavaScript build step. No client framework.

**Surface area**

- `GET /` — Dashboard: cards for drafts in `awaiting_approval`, drafts in `scheduled` (with countdown), recent `published` posts, and an "agent status" tile (last cycle time, last cycle outcome, next scheduled cycle).
- `GET /activities` — List of all detected race activities with state and processed timestamp.
- `GET /activities/{id}` — Detail page: race summary, "feeling" text, all four drafts with media previews, per-draft action buttons (approve / approve & post now / edit / regenerate / reject), and a "scheduled for" editor for any draft in `scheduled` state.
- `GET /sponsors`, `POST /sponsors` — Form-based editor for `sponsors.yaml`. Validates structure on submit.
- `GET /style/{lang}`, `POST /style/{lang}` — Markdown editor for the language's style examples file.
- `GET /settings` — Read-only view of effective config (env vars, redacted secrets) plus action buttons: **Poll now**, **Run reflect**, **Toggle dry-run**.
- `GET /healthz` — JSON liveness for self-check.

**Security & access**

- Bound to `127.0.0.1:WEB_UI_PORT` only — never exposed externally.
- No authentication. Any user on the laptop can use it; that's the rider, by definition.
- All write actions are CSRF-protected via a per-process token in templates (defence in depth even on localhost).

**Behaviour**

- Every action in the UI writes to the same DB rows the Telegram bot writes to. Source-of-truth is shared; the agent loop reads DB state regardless of which surface produced it.
- The dashboard auto-refreshes pending-approval and scheduled cards every 15 seconds via HTMX polling. Cheap and robust.

## 11. Error handling

| Failure mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Strava API down or rate-limited | Skip cycle; retry on next tick; if 5 consecutive failures, Telegram alert |
| Strava token refresh fails | Telegram alert with the manual re-auth CLI command |
| Drafter sub-agent fails | Orchestrator retries once with a higher temperature; on second failure, Telegram alert with raw activity data so rider can post manually |
| `send_for_approval` invariant rejection (missing sponsor) | Orchestrator re-spawns drafter with explicit reminder; capped at 3 attempts |
| Meta publish failure (transient) | Retry 3× with exponential backoff; on final failure, Telegram alert with the approved draft text and media paths |
| Meta publish failure (permission/auth) | Telegram alert with the specific Graph API error so rider can fix in Meta Business |
| Telegram bot disconnect | python-telegram-bot auto-reconnects; missed updates are recovered via long-polling offset |
| Process crash | Next process start reads DB, finds in-flight drafts, resumes (idempotent design) |
| Laptop sleep mid-cycle | DeepAgent invocation fails; next scheduler tick on wake re-invokes from clean state — DB is the source of truth |

## 12. Testing strategy

- **Unit tests** per node, mocking Strava / Meta / LLM / Telegram at boundaries.
- **Recorded fixtures:** real Strava activity JSON for a race and a non-race ride; real Meta API response shapes for success and error cases.
- **Style regression tests:** a small set of golden race contexts with assertions on the drafter sub-agent output — length within range, all sponsors present, no banned phrases, language matches request. Use a cheap classifier prompt for the qualitative checks, with a deterministic seed.
- **Tool invariant tests:** assert each invariant-enforcing tool actually rejects bad input (missing sponsor, wrong status, etc.).
- **Dry-run mode:** `--dry-run` flag on `serve` short-circuits publishers to log instead of post; lets the rider exercise the full loop end-to-end against a real Telegram bot without risking real social posts.
- **Smoke test target:** seed the DB with a fixture race activity, run one cycle, verify (a) drafts created, (b) Telegram messages sent, (c) on simulated approval, draft moves to `scheduled` with the correct `scheduled_for`, (d) on simulated time-passage, `publish_due_drafts` fires the dry-run publishers with correctly-formed payloads.
- **Web UI tests:** FastAPI TestClient covers happy paths for each route; CSRF rejection asserted on a POST without token; HTMX endpoints assert correct partial fragments.
- **Reflect tests:** golden `approval_events` fixture → expected proposal diff structure (presence of sections, no autonomous file writes).

## 13. Configuration

A single `.env` file in the project root:

```
STRAVA_CLIENT_ID=
STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET=
STRAVA_REFRESH_TOKEN=
STRAVA_ATHLETE_ID=

META_APP_ID=
META_APP_SECRET=
META_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN=
META_PAGE_ID=
META_IG_BUSINESS_ID=

TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=

ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=

POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS=600
ORCHESTRATOR_MODEL=claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
DRAFTER_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-6
REFLECTOR_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-6
DB_PATH=./data/cycling.db
DRY_RUN=false
LOG_LEVEL=INFO

PUBLISH_TIME_LOCAL=19:00
PUBLISH_TIMEZONE=Europe/Lisbon

WEB_UI_HOST=127.0.0.1
WEB_UI_PORT=8765
```

A first-run CLI command (`cycling-agent setup`) walks the rider through obtaining each token interactively and writes the file.

## 14. Open questions

- **Photo-only posts.** Some races warrant a quick photo + caption with no auto-generated stats card. Today the rider can attach a photo that *replaces* the stats card; should there also be a "skip the route map too" option for a pure photo post? Defer until the rider hits the case.
- **Multi-photo carousels.** Instagram supports multi-image carousels; v1 publishes a single image. Add only if requested.
- **Engagement feedback into reflect.** Currently reflect mines `approval_events`; could also mine post engagement (likes, comments, reach) once Meta Insights is wired. Worth it only after a season of data.

## 15. Deferred to post-v1

- **Always-on Raspberry Pi (or similar) deployment.** Same code, same DB schema; only changes are `DB_PATH` location, a `systemd` unit, and a `.env` file move. Worth doing once v1 has been used for a real race weekend and the rider trusts the loop.
- **Stories, Reels, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Threads, Bluesky.** Each is a new publisher implementing the existing `Publisher` protocol; the agent loop and approval flow do not change.
- **Sponsor tiers, rotation, contractual logic.** Replaces the flat `read_sponsors` tool with a context-aware variant; downstream invariants still apply.
- **Authenticated multi-user web UI** (e.g., for a coach or social-media manager).
